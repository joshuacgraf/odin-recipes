    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Ganjang Gejang is raw crab marinated in a soy sauce based brine. This traditional dish
        likely originating in the 17th century is commonplace in Korea where it is very popular 
        and ranges from a high quality, high price dish to a more modestly priced version 
        served in smaller villages near the base of mountains. The dish most often features the 
        horse crab that is native to East Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
        The soy sauce brine is prepared by boiling a mix of spices, vegtables, peppers and 
        fruits before cooling it down and putting live crabs in it to cure them for a few days. 
        The curing process is analagous to ceviche. The dish is savory, sweet and surprisingly 
        refreshing. It is served with rice and other sides as is normally done in Korea. For 
        those in the United States such as myself, this dish can be found in Los Angeles and 
        New York City at the least.
